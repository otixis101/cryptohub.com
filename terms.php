            <p>
              2.1. Actions with Cryptocurrencies carry inherent risks. Due to
              the fact that Cryptocurrencies are unregulated and decentralized,
              their value is not insured by any legal entities. The value of any
              Contract, any amount of any Cryptocurrency is subject to change by
              SHAMINING due to a number of factors out of SHAMINING’ control.
              These factors include but are not limited to changes of mining
              difficulty and/or other mining parameters/properties, fluctuating
              price (in fiat currency to Cryptocurrency exchange rate, such as
              USD/BTC) of Cryptocurrencies. You understand and agree that the
              worth of any Contact and any amount of mined Cryptocurrency may
              lose all worth at any moment of time due to the nature of
              Cryptocurrencies. You understand that you are solely responsible
              for management of the Cryptocurrencies in your balance as well as
              any losses or charges incurred by any third-party entity.

              the Website, in the Panel, via the Support Service, via Email
              newsletter, in social media) is subject to change.
            </p>

              otherwise use or exploit Cryptocurrencies in any way which is
              prohibited by the laws or regulations which apply to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2. Cryptocurrencies may not be appropriate for everyone. Before
              mining any Cryptocurrencies you should learn about them to ensure
              that they are appropriate for you. Like all currencies, there are
              disadvantages to using Cryptocurrencies. Some of the risks

              3.2.2. transactions with Cryptocurrencies may be unconfirmed for a
              period of time. Although very unlikely, some Cryptocurrency
              transactions may never be confirmed - Cryptocurrency transactions
              which are unconfirmed are not completed;
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.3. transactions with Cryptocurrencies are irreversible - if
              you send any amount of any Cryptocurrency to the wrong person, you
              may be unable to recover those funds;
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.4. Cryptocurrencies may be lost if you lose or forget any PINs
              or passwords necessary to access and spend those Cryptocurrencies;
            </p>

              3.2.5. unknown technical defects inherent in Cryptocurrencies; and
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.6. new regulation which impacts the use of Cryptocurrencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.3. By agreeing to these terms of service or by mining
              Cryptocurrencies by using the Service, you are indicating that you
              understand, are capable of understanding and accept the risks
              associated with Cryptocurrencies.
            </p>

              consecutive 21 day period, Payouts and Fees will also be
              temporarily stopped. If during the suspension period, the
              Contract- related mining factors (such as the exchange rate and
              mining difficulty) that are outside of SHAMINING’s control will
              change favorably, making mining profitable again, the Service will
              be unsuspended and contracts reactivated. Initial cost is not
              refunded after contract ends.
            </p>

              for which the Cloud Machine is mining. Miners will only be able to
              administer the Cloud Machine during the Contract Term. Those
              Cryptocurrencies will be transferred to your wallet upon your
              request, if such request is confirmed.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
              18.1. When pledging a contract, you receive the residual value
              from the contract on the balance of your trading account,
              depending on the number of days remaining on the contract.
            </p>
            <p>
              18.2. When pledging at least one of the contracts, all withdrawals
              from the account become unavailable.
            </p>
            <p>
              18.3. You can pledge any number of contracts and for any amount.
            </p>
            <p>
              18.4. The repayment of the pledged contract can be made at any
              time from the contract account for the amount that was pledged.
            </p>
